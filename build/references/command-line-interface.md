`--coreth-config` \(json\):

This allows you to specify a config to be passed into Coreth, the VM running the C Chain. The default values for this config are:

```cpp
{
    "snowman-api-enabled": false,

    "net-api-enabled": true,
    "rpc-gas-cap": 2500000000,
    "rpc-tx-fee-cap": 100,
    "eth-api-enabled": true,
    "personal-api-enabled": true,
    "tx-pool-api-enabled": true,
    "debug-api-enabled": false,
    "web3-api-enabled": true
}
```

Note: if a config is specified, all default options are overridden. For example:

```text
./build/avalanchego --config-file=config.json
```

config.json:

```cpp
{
    "coreth-config": {
        "snowman-api-enabled": false,
        "coreth-admin-api-enabled": false,
        "net-api-enabled": true,
        "rpc-gas-cap": 2500000000,
        "rpc-tx-fee-cap": 100,

        "debug-api-enabled": true,
        "web3-api-enabled": true
    }
}
```

Since the option `personal-api-enabled` is excluded, it will be set to false and disable the `personal_*` namespace.

* `tx-pool-api-enabled` -&gt; Enables `txpool_*` API.
* `debug-api-enabled` -&gt; Enables `debug_*` API.
