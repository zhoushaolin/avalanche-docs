# 通过Avalanche创建Ledger Nano S

安全保护加密数字货币的行业标准是硬件钱包，这是一种专用的设备，可以将您的电脑和私人密钥完全隔离。

如果要使用先前创建的Avalanche地址，则需要使用从Avalanche钱包中获得的助记词执行[从助记词还原](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360005434914)程序。若创建新的地址，只需遵循常规的[创建为新设备]( https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000613793-set-up-as-new-device )程序。

If you want to use the Avalanche address you created earlier, you need to use the [restore from recovery phrase](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360005434914) procedure using mnemonic phrase you got from the Avalanche wallet. If you're setting up a fresh address, just follow regular [set up as new device](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000613793-Set-up-as-new-device) procedure.

The Avalanche Ledger wallet app is currently available via [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live) in Experimental Mode.

## How to Set Up Avalanche on Ledger Live <a id="1c80"></a>

First, you’ll need to install [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live). There’s a download for MacOS, Windows and Linux as well as iOS and Android.

Next, fire up Ledger Live and click the “Settings” button.

## Use the Avalanche Wallet with Ledger <a id="48a3"></a>

Once you have the Avalanche app installed then you’re able to interact with the [Avalanche Wallet](https://wallet.avax.network/) via the Ledger. This includes sending AVAX, tokens, NFTs, cross-chain swaps between the X-Chain&lt;-&gt;P-Chain as well as staking tokens.

First, to access the wallet, plug in the Ledger to your computer and if needed, enter your pin.

Next, if you see the text “Pending Ledger review” then click both buttons on the top of the device to skip that screen.

To transfer funds, go to the “Send” tab and paste an X-Address into the “To Address” field. Set an amount and optionally set a memo. Press "Confirm" and then the “Send Transaction” button.

![Send Transaction](../../../.gitbook/assets/send-transaction.png)

You’ll be prompted to confirm the action on your Ledger. Check that the hash which is displayed in the web wallet matches what is displayed on your Ledger. If everything matches then confirm by pressing both buttons on the last screen to send the transaction.

You can click the icon to refresh your balance and you should see it decrease per the amount which you just sent and the transaction fee.

In the right-hand column, you will see your latest transaction. Clicking the magnifying glass icon will open the transaction in our explorer.

Finally, you should be able to see the transaction details in our explorer. This lists everything about the transaction, including transaction ID, status, when the transaction occurred, and all of the information regarding inputs and outputs.
